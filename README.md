DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_USER=postgres
DATABASE_PASSWORD=postgres

DATABASE_URL=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:54326543/sinah

ALLOWED_ORIGINS=localhost:3000

JWT_REFRESH_TOKEN_TTL=1d
JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_TTL=1h
JWT_ISSUER=sinah
JWT_AUDIENCE=http://localhost:8080
```

> [!NOTE]
> When running `make run` or `make docker-start`, all fields defined in the .env will be injected in your environment

### Validate requirements

This project requires `Docker` and `Java (21)` to be installed for run the database (PostgreSQL) and the API (Spring

You can use the help command `make validate` to validate if you environment are ready to lauch the project.

```console
Validating system requirements...
âœ… All requirements are installed
```
